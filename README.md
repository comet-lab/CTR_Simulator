# CTR_Simulator
This is Concentric Tube Robot (CTR) simulator developed based on the open-source code from [CRVisToolKit](https://github.com/ContinuumRoboticsLab/CRVisToolkit).

This simulator is developed to help the student mastering the concept of CTR kinematics (Forward and Inverse Kinematics) and the principle of tube design. The student will design their tube parameters, and then use the tubes to target certain points in world frame. This project specially designed based on the learning pipeline introduced in [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06943), and this project is in early development form.
